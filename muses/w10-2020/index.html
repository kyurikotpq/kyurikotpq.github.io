        <p>I know by now that life <em>is</em> a rollercoaster, but this week was an entire rollercoaster on its own.</p>
<p>Late last week, I was informed that I was selected to audition for the Graduation Rep role. The Graduation Rep is the Chosen One who will give a speech to his/her peers on ceremony day; as this person need not be the top student, my school has decided to use the term &quot;Graduation Rep&quot; instead of the more common &quot;Valedictorian&quot;.</p>
<p>There were two helping questions to get us started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can only share 1 thing with your peers, what would that be?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is something you would like the audience to know about the polytechnic journey that your friends and you went through, what would that be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These questions lurked at the back of my mind for a few days. I had a few stories that I wanted to share, but insecurity got the better of me eventually. My journey had been so different from the rest; what if I couldn't package it into a relatable way for the audience? What if I come across as arrogant, even when I've consciously tried not to? :?</p>
<p>While in the shower on Sunday, I had an epiphany: I could share others' stories instead of my own as long as these stories are relatable. By Tuesday, I had my entire speech outlined with the story of my role model, Lindsey Stirling, as the opener. All that's left for me to do was to write the actual words, rehearse, and then ace the audition next week.</p>
<hr>
<p>Then, on Wednesday morning, I received a text message from the coordinating lecturer that our graduation ceremony would be &quot;decentralised&quot; due to COVID-19 and the Graduation Rep role is thus no longer needed.</p>
<p>I was fine about not being a Graduation Rep but... a &quot;decentralised&quot; graduation? What does that mean? Will we be having our ceremony in tutorial rooms? Will friends - not just immediate family members - be allowed to attend? If it ends up being a mere collection of certs... well, I'll be very disappointed for sure. The thought of it all makes me feel so sad :/</p>
<p>That evening, I made my way to Mountbatten for another Toastmaster's club chapter meeting. I was hit by my second disappointment of the day: The club had cancelled their chapter meeting due to COVID-19. It was my fault though - I had forgotten that COVID-19 exists, that large gatherings would most likely be cancelled because of it, and thus forgot to check in with my friend beforehand on whether their chapter meeting would be held.</p>
<p>Determined not to waste the evening, I googled for the nearest Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf outlet. Thankfully, there were two at the nearby Singapore Sports Hub, so I embarked on a 15min stroll. I was able to treat myself to a small cup of Chocolate Cookie Crumble and finish an assignment before 8.45pm. Afterward, I made my way to the patio near the Kallang River. It was peaceful, breezy, and beautiful - I had a good view of the lit-up buildings in the Central Business District.</p>
<p>It struck me, then: the last time I had seen these buildings from the Sports Hub was in 2018. My ex-boyfriend had brought me here for dinner, and we had enjoyed the same view to kill some time before the New Year fireworks at midnight.</p>
<p>A lot of things have happened since then. I felt like trash for a few months because of our breakup; started and finished my stressful but fruitful internship; performed badly at the Guangzhou friendly match; visited the beautiful city of Kazan for the second time, this time with the rest of Team SG and all of my wonderful coaches; applied for the WorldSkills Champions' Trust, but was rejected; volunteered to be a teaching assistant for an alumni workshop; stressed about resume writing and interview prep but was thankfully accepted by the company on New Year's Eve; did my Icebreaker speech as a Toastmaster; helped out for Open House even though I had unfinished projects; emceed for alumni homecoming; barely finished said projects properly and in time.</p>
<p><em>I went through all of that in a year?</em></p>
<p>That was when all of my disappointments for the week dissipated.</p>
<p>Yes, I had worked hard for three years in hopes that I'll be able to stand on stage as the most decorated student of my cohort. Yes, I had felt that the <em>bling bling</em> of a big-hall, &quot;centralised&quot; ceremony would be a validation of my efforts for the past three years.</p>
<p>But when I started counting my blessings - most of my goals became reality; I secured a job before I graduated; I have a thoughtful boyfriend who is also a great listener; I live in Singapore, where our healthcare system is decent and price hikes on necessities are illegal; Singapore's COVID-19 situation isn't as bad as other countries around the world - the <em>bling bling</em> doesn't feel as important anymore.</p>
<p>Wanting a big-hall ceremony at the risk of creating another local COVID-19 cluster feels very selfish and ungrateful when I know that my friend in Iran lives fearfully every day as the COVID-19 situation in his country worsens.</p>
<p>From now on, I always will look at the bigger picture so that I don't wallow in needless disappointment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thankfully, my Toastmasters club didn't cancel the Humourous Speech contests on Friday evening. The contestants were adept at the art of humour and it was a night of fun and laughter. It also happened to be the first day of my period, so it's no surprise that 3 hours of standing during the speech contests would ellicit lower backaches the next morning. Hopefully these aches go away soon.</p>
