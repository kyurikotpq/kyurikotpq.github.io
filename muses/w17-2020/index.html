        <p>This week, I got lost in other people's priorities.</p>
<p>There were multiple emails trails to follow; there were some merges to be done with my teammate; some bugs popped up for me to fix on my software robot.</p>
<p>Add intermittent diarrhoea and subconscious coronavirus panic into the mix, and <em>boom</em>. I became very busy, but less productive than last week. I stopped using my calendar and, as a result, nearly forgot to attend some of my meetings. Nearly.</p>
<p>I also developed pain in the base of my ring finger as I typed, so I took more breaks than usual. That only increased my frustrations as I watched my list of to-dos grow.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I had put in place reminders to stop myself from falling off the track completely. One of those reminders is a practice highlighted in Brendon Burchard's book, <em>High Performance Habits</em>. Basically,</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide on at least three words you want to <em>be/feel</em></li>
<li>Set an alarm to go off at a certain time every day, with those three words as the alarm label</li>
<li>When the alarm goes off, take time to remember and feel the meaning of those three words.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have more than three words, you can set multiple alarms throughout the day, each alarm labelled with different sets of words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grateful, Blessed, Unshakeable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the words I'd set to pop up right before I break for lunch.</p>
<p>At first, I'd swipe off the notification and continue working - it felt like a distraction to me. Over time, however, I decided to view this notification as though it's a cat that's trying to get my attention.</p>
<p>When cats demand your attention, you <em>have</em> to give it to them. Thus, I started taking five seconds to breathe, feel, and relax before dismissing the notification. This deliberate act turned out to be a good distraction that gradually got me back on track. By Friday, I was able to continue my <a href="https://toggl.com">time-tracking practice</a> <em>and</em> knock off a few items in my Trello board.</p>
<p>In the upcoming week, I'll get back to the habit of using my calendar.</p>
<p>Also, since I don't have a cat, and <strong>R</strong>eminder starts with <strong>R</strong>, I'm going to call my alarm app a <em>Reminder Reindeer</em> from now on :)</p>
<hr>
<p>Toastmasters meeting on Saturday (today!) was fun, too! I was the Table Topics Master for this week's meeting and there was a bit of confusion for one particular instance (my fault). Otherwise, it went okay. I'm thankful that my clubmates are so encouraging. I'll do better next time!</p>
<h1>This week, I pray that...</h1>
<ul>
<li>May the coronavirus pandemic die down around the world for good <em>(no second wave pls)</em></li>
<li>May those who are being hit severely by the consequences of the pandemic receive enough aid to successfully tide over this period</li>
<li>May my carpal tunnel syndrome (I hope not, but I think that's what the finger pain is all about) recover completely in the upcoming month. I'll take care of you, just dont blow up :')</li>
</ul>
