        <p>I had a frantic start to the week.</p>
<p>One of my responsibilities as Vice President (Public Relations) is to design promotional banners for my Toastmasters club. The banner for May 8 was overdue and I felt uneasy about leaving it as such, so I decided to power through the designs of the last four chapter meetings (May 8 - June 12) on Monday afternoon. Thankfully, Pixabay had the kind of pictures I wanted, and I managed to finish the banners by Monday night.</p>
<p>Tuesday and Wednesday was dedicated to the preparations for the Lee Hsien Loong Smart Nation Competition (LHL SNC) presentation next week. I crafted the first draft of slides and script and explored using WorkManager to keep services alive in the background. Sadly, WorkManager is unable to keep services alive on Chinese phones (Huawei, OPPO, etc.) when the user swipes away the app. This is because Chinese phones - running customised flavours of Android - force stop apps that are swiped away to improve battery performance, and WorkManager will only resume when the app is re-opened again. In the interest of time, my LHL SNC team - our supervisor Mr Michael, my partner Poh Heng, myself - decided to put aside accounting for Chinese phones for the upcoming round of presentations.</p>
<p>Thursday morning was spent optimising the next batch of competitor's WordPress codes. There wasn't much to optimise though; the coaches have taught them well. In the afternoon, I tried helping Poh Heng with the issues on the Android app, but to no avail - I couldn't understand why my &quot;solution&quot; isn't a solution. I didn't manage to rehearse my slides and script as I'd planned, which left me feeling discouraged.</p>
<p>Friday morning was my interview for the Lee Kuan Yew Distinguished Award - something I'd been eyeing since the first day of school three years ago. As the interview drew near, however, I decided to let go of that attachment and just do my best. Apart from a handful of rambling episodes, the interview went well. My course manager told me on Saturday that I'd made it to the final round of interviews _/|\_</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, I had a rehearsal for LHL SNC. Since I didn't manage to rehearse the day before, I was very unpolished during the rehearsal and had to firefight the stumbles that popped up. Thankfully, Mr Michael was very kind, and gave me lots of feedback on improving my presentation.</p>
<p>I only managed to incorporate these tips on Sunday, however, because I'd decided to tag along with my sister on Saturday to her staycation in Malaysia at the very last minute. No doubt, it was a questionable decision: I ended up being very unproductive on Saturday. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the opportunity to enjoy the picturesque view of the Airbnb's neighbourhood - it reminded me of some of my long-term goals and gave me the push I needed to be productive on Sunday.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Till next week!</p>
