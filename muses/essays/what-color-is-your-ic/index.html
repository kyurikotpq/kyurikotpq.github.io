        <p>When I received my identification card, or <em>IC</em>, back in 2015, I was told that it is a <strong>VIP</strong> - <em>Very Important Plastic</em>. In the words of my grandmother, if I lost my IC,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Someone is going to pick it up, use it to borrow money from loansharks, and thenâ€¦ tsk tsk tsk... your life will be <strong>hell!</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was terrified of the scenario my grandmother had described and, as a result, became hyper-aware of other people's ICs and my own.</p>
<p>For instance, when I queued at the clinic, I would observe that the person in front of me had a blue IC instead of a pink one like mine. Wikipedia told me that the blue IC is for Permanent Residents, while the pink one is for citizens.</p>
<p>Indeed, the IC is useful for identifying a person based on their &quot;responses&quot; to certain &quot;questions&quot; like nationality and gender. By this definition, all of us have a second IC. It's intangible - you can't see it, you can't touch it, but you can <em>feel</em> it - and we carry it with us all the time, even when we're sleeping.</p>
<h1>&quot;Tell me more about yourself.&quot;</h1>
<p>If I use my physical IC to answer this question, my answer would be something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hi, I'm Pei Qi, a female born on the 1st of January in the year 1999.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>... which is something that will raise eyebrows, but not in a good way.</p>
<p>However, if I use my second IC to answer this question, my answer would sound much better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hi, I'm Pei Qi, a versatile software developer with strengths in web development and data science.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the question our second IC answers best.</p>
