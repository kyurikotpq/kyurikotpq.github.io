        <p>You can succeed anywhere if you...</p>
<h1>Have these things</h1>
<h2>self-awareness</h2>
<p><em>awareness of what you like and don't like (at the very least)</em></p>
<h2>desire/hunger</h2>
<p><em>do you want it badly enough?</em></p>
<h2>resilience</h2>
<p><em>can you stand up after every fall?</em></p>
<h2>flexibility</h2>
<p><em>when circumstances change, can you pivot fast enough?</em></p>
<h1>Do these things</h1>
<h2>pursue your own definition of success.</h2>
<p><em>you'll be happier and more motivated to achieve it.</em></p>
<h2>take action towards your dream</h2>
<p><em>if you don't take a step forward, you will stay where you are.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1>Why do I say this?</h1>
<p>Years ago, I had scored near-straight A1s for my GCE &quot;O&quot; Levels (secondary school leaving examination). I had two choices for my post-secondary education:</p>
<h3>Junior College (2 years)</h3>
<p>Equivalent to a high school where I'd learn subjects like Chemistry, Physics and Math, mostly from an academic, theoretical perspective</p>
<h3>Polytechnic (3 years)</h3>
<p>Equivalent to a vocational school where I'd learn the ins and outs of a trade, mostly through a hands-on, skills-based approach</p>
<hr>
<p>My family members wanted me to pursue my degree as soon as possible, so they urged me to go to junior college.</p>
<p>My teachers felt that I'd &quot;be in better company&quot; in a junior college than a polytechnic.</p>
<p>On 17 April 2017, despite objections from everyone around me, I started my freshman year at Nanyang Polytechnic.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Why did I &quot;rebel&quot;?</h1>
<h2>I was blessed with self-awareness</h2>
<p>I knew that I wanted to pursue either/both Digital Design and IT - subjects that I'll never touch on in junior college.</p>
<p>I knew that I learnt best through practicals/hands-on sessions.</p>
<p>I knew that the mastery of design and IT is acquired with practice, not pure theory.</p>
<p>I knew that I am a consistent worker that can score well for day-to-assignments - a trait that allows me to do better in the scoring system of a polytechnic than a junior college.</p>
<p>Unlike graduating from polytechnic, I would have no monetisable skills after I graduate from junior college. Thus, I would have no other option but to retake GCE &quot;A&quot; Levels/go to private university if I didn't score well.</p>
<p>And I <em>detest</em> the idea of having one exam deciding my entire fate.</p>
<h2>Someone else had done it too</h2>
<p>Because of how our education system is structured, most polytechnics students were in the poorer-scoring portion of the cohort for the national exams.</p>
<p>As such, a deep-rooted bias against polytechnic students formed in the entire country: <em>Since their results are so bad, polytechnic students must be the kind of people who &quot;don't want study&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>I was explicitly judged as such by a taxi driver, after he found out that I was a polytechnic student during our friendly conversation.</p>
<p>But I knew that there are a thousand factors that could pull down someone's academic performance - factors beyond their control and they had to make do with. They may not have the resources to afford private tuition and get more help. They may not have a conducive household to study in after school.</p>
<p>And then in 2016, the year I was due to take my &quot;O&quot; Levels, an alumnus of Nanyang Polytechnic was accepted by <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/harvard-and-mit-both-want-this-poly-graduate">four of the top colleges in the US</a> - Harvard, MIT, Carnegie Mellon University and New York University.</p>
<p><strong>He had scored seven As at the &quot;O&quot; levels.</strong></p>
<p>If studying in polytechnic was such a terrible choice like that taxi driver had described, this alumnus of Nanyang Polytechnic wouldn't exist. A <strong>desire</strong> in me started to form: I wanted to prove it to my family members (at least) that they were wrong about polytechnic students... and that I can <strong>succeed in any endeavour I choose to pursue</strong>.</p>
<p>And thus, I rebelled.</p>
<hr>
<h1>I set my own definition of success</h1>
<p>It was a simple 3-year plan that consisted of outcomes:</p>
<h3>Graduate at the top of my cohort with straight distinctions and the Lee Kuan Yew Distinguished Award</h3>
<h3>Score straight As for my Diploma Plus modules</h3>
<h3>Be a Worldskills Singapore 2018 Gold Medallist (Web Design and Development)</h3>
<h3>Be WorldSkills Kazan 2019 Gold Medallist (Web Design and Development)</h3>
<h3>Be a WorldSkills Kazan 2019 Albert Vidal Awardee</h3>
<h1>I took action towards my dreams</h1>
<p>I kept my radar on for WorldSkills selections since the first day of school.</p>
<p>I told my would-be coaches that I was willing to learn - my lack of background in programming, let alone web design and development, would not be an issue.</p>
<p>Even though WorldSkills training became tougher and tougher as I progressed, I persisted and held on.</p>
<p>Eventually, I had to juggle training and maintaining my GPA - and I never felt that it was a huge struggle. I focused on chipping away at each task, chunk by chunk, and got things done.</p>
<hr>
<h1>I fell... face flat. A lot of times.</h1>
<p>My first fall was at the ASEANSkills Competition in 2018.</p>
<p>Out of 7 competitors from my school, 5 of us had a Gold/Silver/Bronze medal or a Medallion of Excellence.</p>
<p>I was one of the 2 competitors who came home empty-handed.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine being a national champion, only to be told that you suck on the world stage. That really hurt.</strong></p>
<p>Back then, I was still a &quot;brooding hen&quot; - I instinctively dwell and wallow on shortcomings.</p>
<p>If there was a black dot on a piece of white paper, I would focus on the black dot and how it ruined the paper, instead of appreciating the whiteness around it. As such, I had trouble recovering form my ASEANSkills results.</p>
<p>My coaches knew this, so they allowed me to take a break from WorldSkills for a while. But they kept reminding me that ultimately, only my performance at WorldSkills Kazan 2019 matters. <em>It's better to fail now and learn from your mistakes... than to fail at your final competition in Kazan.</em></p>
<p><strong>Every second I wasted on wallowing could've be used for training.</strong></p>
<h2>Slowly, I learnt how to stand up quickly after each fall.</h2>
<p>I went for Digital Skills, a friendly match held by WorldSkills Russia. I failed a paper and barely passed another.</p>
<p>I went for my final friendly match in Guangzhou, where I ranked 4th out of 6 competitors and was 3 points away from a Medallion of Excellence again.</p>
<p>With my coaches' help, I learnt how to these failures in my stride <em>and</em> started seeing them as <em>learning checkpoints</em> instead of mere &quot;events that happened in my life&quot;.</p>
<p>I kept my eye on the prize - WorldSkills Kazan 2019. And then finally, competition day came.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did not do well for my second day of competition. I knew it in my heart, from the trashy way my website and API looked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had not been flexible enough to pivot my abilities towards the competition tasks.</p>
<p>At the end of my second day, my coaches saw my face and gave me &quot;that look&quot;. I steeled myself and snapped out of it over dinner, focusing on the next day's tasks after a quick shower.</p>
<p>I only allowed myself to cry about the trash and mess and opportunities I've wasted after the last day of competition.</p>
<p>As I later found out, being able to snap out of it quickly saved me from scoring worse. <strong>Being able to shift my focus away from the desired outcome, to instead focus on the <em>process</em> of achieving those outcomes</strong>, had helped.</p>
<p>Eventually, I ranked 5th out of the 32 countries that participated, which is Singapore's best ranking in the Web Technologies trade thus far.</p>
<p>As someone who had <strong>zero</strong> programming knowledge only two years prior, I am grateful for how things had turned out.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Yes, I didn't achieve all of my goals.</h1>
<p>I didn't manage to score straight distinctions - I had one A.</p>
<p>I never took a single Diploma Plus module, nor did I even win a Bronze medal at WorldSkills Kazan 2019 - the Albert Vidal Award was out of the question.</p>
<p>But I did become a WorldSkills Singapore Gold Medallist. I did graduate at the top of my cohort. And in the pursuit of my goals, I was exposed to so many opportunities to learn and grow.</p>
<p>And because of that, I had proven to my family - more importantly, myself - that I can achieve success in <strong>whatever I set my mind towards</strong>.</p>
<p>Sure, I'm still learning about how to be more self-aware, hungry, resilient and flexible.</p>
<p>But 1% growth every day is better than no growth at all.</p>
<h1>You can succeed anywhere.</h1>
<p>If you don't know what you want, <em>explore</em> your options.</p>
<p>If you're still considering your options, my advice to you would be that <em>the right choice is the <strong>most suitable choice</strong>.</em></p>
<p>If you've already made your choice, my advice to you would be to <em>play full out</em>. 10X your goals, as I did with mine. Aim to be the best at what you do... and then <strong>take action</strong> to <em>be</em> the best at what you do.</p>
<p>If you fall, get up as quickly as you can. Make the most of what you have and work actively to get back on track.</p>
<p>One day, you'll look back and realise how far you've come.</p>
<p>To your success,</p>
<p>Tea</p>
