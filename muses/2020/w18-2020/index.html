        <p>This week marks the end of my first month at IBM. I started off strong, picking up RPA from scratch as quickly as I could and completing most of my tasks on time, but the month did not end well. Nearly.</p>
<h1>Treble? No, <em>tremble</em>.</h1>
<p>At 5.34pm on Thursday, my hands were shaking as I fumbled to create the Blue Prism release for my colleague to deploy. Never had I been this panicky - not even during WorldSkills or those three consecutive nights where I slept at 3am to finish Calbitica.</p>
<p>Just 4 minutes before, I had discovered my (very dumb) mistake and begged my colleague to stay for 5 more minutes to do one last deployment before he knocked off.</p>
<p>He's probably annoyed by me and my noob-ness by now, but it's alright - I'll improve with time and annoy him less. Thank you Colleague - I owe you one.</p>
<p>At 5.43pm, the RPA ran as scheduled by my now-knocked off colleague. As I watched the Slack channel intently for the notifications that were to come, I found myself jumping at the arrival of a Slack DM.</p>
<p>It was from another colleague who was in charge of the project; she wanted me to confirm whether she could close the project so that she could hit April's targets.</p>
<p>My anxiety doubled at that message.</p>
<p><em>So, this was what my adult friends meant when they talked about the chaos surrounding their month-end targets.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>At 6.30pm, the run was mostly successful, but it was only for 45 line items; the target load was 700. I sent out an email that described the results as such, highlighting that I will run more tests over the course of the week to ensure that the RPA could handle the target load.</p>
<p>At 7pm, the RPA ended its run without major errors. But I knew that more problems could surface when we ran the files that had 700 line items... and never have I felt more <em>screwed</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Good job, Pei Qi! This is your first job in your entire career and you've screwed it up in your first month. Well done!&quot; — my Inner Critic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was not the first time I'd been told off by my inner critic. Its birth could be traced back to 2014, when I'd succumbed to it daily and <em>unconsciously</em>. Things remained that way until early 2016, when Adam Khoo's book <em>I Am Gifted, So Are You!</em> made me aware of it.</p>
<p>Since then, my awareness of it increased as I progressed on my personal development journey. My speed reading coach, Jim Kwik, calls it &quot;ANTs&quot; - <em>Automatic Negative Thoughts</em> - while entrepreneur Dean Graziosi described it as &quot;The Villain Within&quot; in his book, <em>Millionaire Success Habits</em>. My inner critic was more of an ANT - automatic and habitual - so I did what Jim Kwik recommended his students to do: <em>Squash it</em>.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and slowly exhaled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Not all is lost. The RPA ran successfully. Things will go well in the next scheduled run, which is tomorrow night at 9.30pm.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which brought me to another realisation...</p>
<h1>I worked on a Public Holiday again</h1>
<p>Last year, I had worked on Good Friday to get the bugs of a Photo Booth app fixed. It was due on Tuesday (3 days!!!) and my colleagues were working over the weekend to fix <em>my</em> bugs (very embarrassing sia!!!), so I wanted to help.</p>
<p>This time, the RPA was technically overdue, and my project-in-charge had allowed me to finish the load tests over the course of the week - I could start the observations and tests on Monday.</p>
<p>But I felt compelled to at least take a <em>peek</em> at things on Friday. If things were going south, I wouldn't be blindsided by the errors on Monday.</p>
<p>So, I logged in to Slack on Friday night. The RPA still ran with errors, but unlike before, an error notification was sent to the Slack channel.</p>
<p>Since I'll need the help of my colleagues again to gain access to the server, I guess there's nothing much I can do about it till Monday.</p>
<h1>Anxiety aside...</h1>
<p>I made a lot of progress on another RPA project I was assigned to.</p>
<p>My carpal tunnel syndrome didn't pop up for a few days.</p>
<p>I planted a total of 11 hours on the Forest app across my phone and tablet. I owe a lot of trees to the planting sprints that my server-mates have set up via Discord.</p>
<p>I also got featured in <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/student-who-aced-exams-believes-in-paying-it-forward">The Straits Times</a>, which I am really grateful for!</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>This week, I pray that...</h1>
<p>COVID-19 situations around the world continue to improve - less infections and more recoveries please.</p>
<p>My intermittent diarrhoea goes away.</p>
<p>I'll have the abilities to completely debug my erroneous RPA - <em>once and for all</em> - by Wednesday.</p>
<p>My next 23 months at IBM will proceed smoothly.</p>
