        <p>By Monday, our Android app for the Lee Hsien Loong Smart Nation (LHL SNC) competition was still crashing. Just as Poh Heng and I were about to lose hope, our supervisor Mr Michael stepped in, switching to the use of service binding and callbacks for the communication between the Activity and Service - and it worked! :D By 8.45pm, Poh Heng and I had finished re-structuring the rest of the app while maintaining its stability. We had skipped dinner though; I was famished by the time I finished cooking my instant noodles at home.</p>
<p>Insomnia came to visit on Monday night, and I awoke on Tuesday morning feeling exhausted. <em>It's the last day,</em> I clung on to that hopeful thought as I pushed on with the morning rehearsal with Mr Michael. The actual presentation in the afternoon went alright, though I could definitely have done better.</p>
<p>With the presentation done, I took my mind off coding for a while, finishing my project writeups for my LinkedIn profile and attending my dental and eye appointments. I was given clean bills of health - &quot;no signs of decay&quot; and &quot;your myopia didn't increase from last year&quot; - which I am grateful for.</p>
<p>On Friday, I brought my coaches through the setup of a LAMP server on old CPUs. We started with the installation of Ubuntu, then Apache, MySQL (MariaDB), PHP, NodeJS and PM2 before ending off with the installation and configuration of vsftpd and openssh-server for FTP and SSH.</p>
<p>As I had issues granting php/composer commands to the chroot-ed users in the SSH shell, I wil try to dockerise the entire LAMP stack over the weekend and do the appropriate configurations so that each user has access to his/her own container. Hopefully that goes well.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Singapore announced its first two deaths from the COVID-19 coronavirus. While I agree with our health minister that deaths from the coronavirus is ineviatable, the news was still devastating. Perhaps this conronavirus is more infectious than we thought it was.</p>
