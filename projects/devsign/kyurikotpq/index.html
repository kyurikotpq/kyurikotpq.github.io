        <h1>The Client</h1>
<p>Tea Pei Qi is a application developer and designer currently based in Singapore. Her strengths lie in Web Design and Development, but she's also excited about mastering Robotic Process Automation through her apprenticeship at IBM.</p>
<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>In preparation for an internship back in 2019, Tea rushed her old website and has not updated it since.</p>
<p>While the site looks alright on smaller screens, its interface was <strong>not intuitive enough to navigate through on mobile</strong>. Tea also found it <strong>hard to update</strong> the site's content, fumbling immensely with <strong>formatting</strong> and <strong>deployment on Firebase</strong>.</p>
<h1>The Goal</h1>
<h2>Have an awesome-looking website that...</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compels potential clients to get in touch for projects</li>
<li>Has an intuitive interface for mobile devices</li>
<li>Can be updated easily</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Process</h1>
<h2>Initial Plans</h2>
<p>Tea didn't have a brand yet, so we worked that out first. These were the results of an initial brainstorming session:</p>
<image of mindmap here>
<p>We agreed that a logo wasn't needed for now, so I focused on color and typography.</p>

With a style in place, it was time to design the site.
